# Coffee Machine

This project is a simulation of a coffee machine written in Python.  The purpose of the project was to create a program that could simulate that action of a person choosing a drink and having the coffee machine being able to automatically process the money, create a variety of menu items, and also manage the resources within the machine.  Another functionality of the machine is typing in the keyword 'report' and printing out a list of the amount of resources (water, milk, coffee).  This is kind of like a maintenence function, so if the machine was out of resources an employee could refill it.
  
I completed the code from scratch, it was a part of the 100 Days Of Code course by Angela Yu on Udemy.  The main python skills I used in this project were functions with return statements, dictionaries, and conditional statements.  I also utilized the global function that allows me to tell the function that the variables inside it are coming from the global scope.
